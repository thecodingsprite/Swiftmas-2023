# Swiftmas-2023
#The12DaysOfSwiftmas lives here

Welcome to Swiftmas 2023. A ios Development challenge for programmers of all levels.
Starting December 01st each day we will be building a new app in the countdown to Christmas (for the 1st 12 days anyhow, we all need a festive break!)

Around 9am (GMT) I will post a prompt for a app idea. For those more experienced & those wanting to give it a go then I can't wait to see your projects on social media. Remember to use the hashtag #The12DaysOfSwiftmas & tag me @thecodingsprite

Then around midday each day, I will be posting my idea/version here on github, a completed snapshot of the code on social media & a full detailed tutorial on my website www.thecodingsprite.com for anyone who is still a bit green shall we say & not confident in pursuing their own code from the get go or wanting to indeed learn through another devs thought process.

I truly hope everyone enjoy's this fun challenge & that we can all learn something from each other. No nastiness, only ever constructive criticism please. It's going to be a fun ride & for everyone that joins in the full 12 days I have a Certificate of Completion with your name on it if you wish.

Look forward to seeing all your projects, üßö‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
