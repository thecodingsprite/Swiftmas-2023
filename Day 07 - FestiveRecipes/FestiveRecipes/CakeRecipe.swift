        "Begin by preheating your oven to 180°C / 356°F. At this point it is a good idea to prep your baking tin. I personally use a standard round cake tin with greaseproof paper stuck to the insides using my dairy free butter as the glue. This has always made a great non stick cake tin even more non stick for me personally.",
        
        "To start the cake, we begin by creaming together the butter and sugar in a bowl until fluffy.",
        
        "In a seperate bowl, weigh out & seive the flour, cocoa powder, baking powder & salt. Put this to the side for a moment.",
        
        "If using vanilla essence I prefer to crack my eggs into another seperate bowl, lightly whisk them & then whisk in the vanilla essence to the eggs.",
        
        "Add the eggs bit by bit into the butter & sugar, whisking the whole time. If you have a electric mixer, I do recommend using one as the high speed whisk can stop any curdling process.",
        
        "After your eggs have been whisked into the mixture you will want to slow things down and add your dry ingredients bowl you set to one side earlier. If hand mixing, then fold your flour into the mix, if using an electric mixer, reduce the speed to minimum.",
        
        "Once your mixture is completely mixed, pour your mixture into the prepared cake tin from step 1. Smooth over the top & try to level the cake to ensure it is even on all sides.",
        
        "Bake for around 30-40 miniutes or until cooked. I recommend testing the cake by inserting a knife into the center, if the knife comes back out clean then your cake is cooked, if there is still mixture on the knife, bake for another 5 minutes & test again (repeat the testing & baking until cooked, times can vary based on different ovens).",
        
        "Once cooked, remove from the tin & leave to cool. Once cool we can add the icing"

    static var icingRecipe = [
       "I have never actually measured out my ingredients for the icing. Sometimes I bake two cakes so need ore, sometimes just one. I also adapt the amount of cocoa powder depending on who I am baking for. You ill need a bowl, spoon to mix, icing sugar, cocoa powder & a little water.",
       "In a bowl, add a good amount of icing sugar. I go for about half a pack when doing two cakes, this tends o do the sandwich middle & the top whilst leaving plenty if i add too much water & need to re-thicken the ixture. Roughly add a good 3-4 tablespoons of cocoa powder to the icing sugar. You can add or indeed tart at only 1 or two if you don't want it very chocolatey.",
       "Slowly add a little water & mix. For the consitency, we are going NOT runny! We want a thick fudge like onsitency so adding water slowly is the key. Once you are close to the consistency, I tend to taste the ixture to see whether or not to add more cocoa powder. I would say for a super rich fudge taste probably round 6 tbsp worth in total is what I would use.",
       "Once you are happy with your consitency (going for thick yet smoothable) then grab your cake & begin cing & decorating however you so wish!",
       "Fridge for an hour or two to let the icing set, or if like me...tuck in and enjoy!"
